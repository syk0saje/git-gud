# History

~Git, short for regurgitate, was invented by Nikola Tesla in 1522 BC during the
Australian invasion of Brazil.~

Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel.
He described the tool as "the stupid content tracker"

[*( sauce )*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)

# Concepts

Before we dive into our terminals, I must first explain some core concepts for
understanding:

- the basics of how git works
- what git is for
- what git is ***not*** for

## Repositories

What is a git repository?

Is it a database? Is it a cloud? Is it a magical bucket of time travel voodoo?

No.

A git repository is nothing but a **directory with a memory**.

But what exactly does this directory remember?

## Commits

Commits are the heart and soul of git.

But like electromagnetic radiation, commits have a dual nature.

Commits are snapshots of the **state** of the directory. This includes:

- the directory structure

```
my-special-app
├─ README.md
├─ LICENSE.md
└─ src
   ├─ server.clj
   ├─ client.cljs
   └─ garbage.py
```

- file contents

```
garbage.py
==========
import unseparatedwords from unreadablepackagename
# TODO: Make this more readable
```

However, commits can also be thought of as changes that were made against the
previous state of the directory (also known as the **parent commit**). This
includes:

- a summary of the changes (known as the **commit message**)

```text
"Do some stuff to the things"
"Attackclone the grit repo pushmerge"
"Rubygem the lymphnode js shawarma module"
```

[*( sauce )*](http://html9responsiveboilerstrapjs.com/)

- a comparison of the line-by-line differences between the current state and the
previous state (known as a **diff**)

```diff
+ this line was added

- this line was removed

- this line was modified
+ this line was MODIFIED!?
```

However you think about commits, they are uniquely
identified by **commit hashes** which are long strings of alphanumeric
characters that look something like this:

```
d6bcd058881833443e7b1592c44d101d10a1f176
```

(Under the hood, however, git objects are all [snapshots, not deltas](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics))

## Branches

Yikes! Those commit hashes look really nasty. Can't we use something that's more
human-readable?

I thought you'd never ask! Let me introduce you to **branches**!

Git branches are simply pointers to specific commits. The default branch of
every new git repository is `master`, but you can make as many branches as your
gitty little heart desires! `bug-ridden-feature`? Go ahead! `hackiest-fix-ever`?
Why not? `regrettable-experiment`? Knock yourself out! Sure beats typing out
`d6bcd058881833443e7b1592c44d101d10a1f176`!

### HEAD

While we're on the topic of pointers, let me introduce you to a special pointer.
`HEAD` is shorthand for **the commit you're pointing to right now**. You will
generally have `HEAD` pointing to one of your several silly branches...

```
HEAD -> my-silly-branch -> d6bcd058881833443e7b1592c44d101d10a1f176
```

...but sometimes you might need to point head towards a commit *directly*,
meaning you're not pointing to a branch. In this case, we say you have a
**detached head**.

```
HEAD -> d6bcd058881833443e7b1592c44d101d10a1f176
```

**\*shudders\***

Creepy.

### Commit Identifiers

For our purposes, when I say "commit identifier", I mean any of the following
- `HEAD`
- a branch name (like `master` or `not-master`)
- a commit hash (like `d6bcd058881833443e7b1592c44d101d10a1f176`)

## Remotes

Git is a DVCS and the D stands for **distributed** and the VCS stands for **Very
Cool Software™**. What this means is that git has a way of referring to
instances of the same repository on other machines. This reference is what we
call a **remote**.

This allows machines running git to talk to each other in order to synchronize
changes and resolve conflicts. More often than not, however, you will be using
just one remote which points to the authoritative version of the repository. In
our case, this is usually the one on Github.

The default name for this remote is `origin` and it's automatically set if you
**clone** the repository from that remote. On this remote, the `master` branch
is usually reserved for the latest production-ready code and is therefore
commonly protected from accidental or unauthorized modifications.

# Commands

Now that we've covered the basics, it's time to get our hands dirty as we
punch keys on an old unsanitized keyboard full of crumbs and dead skin!

## Baby's first git

### init

How do we turn a boring old ordinary directory into a magical repository of
git sorcery?

```sh
git init <BORING_DIRECTORY> # <BORING_DIRECTORY> defaults to your current directory
```

This will create a `.git` directory inside your boring directory. That's it.
That's all there is to it. Nothing fancy. Git over it. Let's move on.

Oh, also ***DON'T YOU EVER TOUCH THE `.git` DIRECTORY, DO YOU HEAR ME???***

At least not until you get your Level 42 Git Wizard Certification.

### clone

If there is an existing repository that you want to ~~steal~~ copy, you can
instead use the clone command like so:

```sh
git clone <REMOTE_URL_OF_YOUR_TARGET_REPO>
```

You may have encountered this on Github. If possible, prefer `ssh` over the
`https` option. That way, you won't need to keep entering your credentials when
connecting to the remote repository. You will need to upload your public ssh
key though.

## Baby learns to read

After creating a repository, you need to learn how to browse it.

### branch

You can list all the local branches in your repository:

```sh
git branch
```

Add the `-a` / `--all` option to also list remote-tracking branches, which are
basically your repository's latest knowledge of the state of a branch on a
remote. They generally look like `<REMOTE_NAME>/<BRANCH_NAME>`. For example,
`origin/master`.

You can create new branches:

```sh
git branch michelle
```

Great, now you've made the `michelle` branch, but how do you switch over to it?
In other terms, how do you make `HEAD` point to `michelle`?

### checkout

The act of changing where your `HEAD` points is called **checking out**.
This is how we check out the `michelle` branch:

```sh
git checkout michelle
```

You can create a branch and immediately check it out too:

```sh
git checkout -b nudibranch
```

Remember the **detached head** state we were talking about earlier? Now you
learn how to detach your own `HEAD`!

```sh
git checkout <SOME_COMMIT_HASH>
```

### log

Alright, I'm on a branch, but now I wanna know its history. How do I do that?

```sh
git log
```

If you want something fancier:

```sh
git log --graph --pretty='\''%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset'\'
```

Remember that command by heart. Or use an alias, I don't care.

### show

Now that you can see the history of a branch, you want... even ***more***. You
want the power to see what changes were made in a specific commit. You realize
at this point that you are drunk with git but your cravings will never be sated.

.

.

.

**Let's use `git show`! ^\_\_^**

```sh
git show # This will show your current `HEAD`
git show <SOME_BRANCH>
git show <SOME_COMMIT_HASH>
```

## Baby learns to walk

### config

Before you can start ~~breaking core functionalities~~ making valuable
contributions to any repository, you will need to have configured git with your
information like so:

```sh
git config user.email '<YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS>'
git config user.name '<YOUR_NAME>'
```

Make sure not to leave out the ***Really Important Parts™***:

```sh
git config user.master_password '<YOUR_MASTER_PASSWORD>'
git config user.social_security_number '<YOUR_SOCIAL_SECURITY_NUMBER>'
git config user.mothers_maiden_name '<YOUR_MOTHERS_MAIDEN_NAME>'
```

## Baby learns to make a mess

Below is the git file lifecycle. Take a moment to bask in its glory.

![git file lifecycle](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/lifecycle.png "git file lifecycle")

Each arrow above has a corresponding command below. Except for *Edit the file*.
If you need my help with editing the file, get out of my goddamned class.

### add

This command lets you *Add the file* and *Stage the file*, the difference only
depending on whether the file was initially *Untracked* or *Modified*.

```
git add <SOME_FILE> <MAYBE_ANOTHER_FILE> <DONT_YOU_DARE_ADD_FOUR_FILES> <JUST_KIDDING_ITS_FINE>
git add <SOME_FILE_GLOB>
```

For `<SOME_FILE_GLOB>`, you can use:

- entire directories (`.`)
- wildcards (`*.md`)
- combinations (`subdirectory/*.txt`)
- `--all` to stage everything that can be, you careless maniac

#### Binary Files

Because of how git works, it is generally considered bad practice to include
huge files in git repositories, especially when they are non-text, i.e. **binary**. Common examples are multimedia files (**assets**) and executable files. There are
many other options for storing and hosting these kinds of files. When in doubt
about whether or not you should add a file to a git repository, ask your nearest
data engineer for assitance.

### reset

#### Files

This command serves as the reverse of *Add the file* and *Stage the file*, the
difference only depending on whether the file was initially *Untracked* or
*Modified*. It uses the same syntax as `git add` except with `reset` instead of
`add`.

#### Branches

This command also serves another purpose: changing where the current branch
points to:

```sh
git reset <SOME_COMMIT_IDENTIFIER> # <SOME_COMMIT_IDENTIFIER> defaults to `HEAD`
```

For example if your current `HEAD` is like this:

```
HEAD -> point-me-elsewhere -> 90fa092637f7c88e5e04efcba59a92f6ae2149b5
```

Running the following:

```sh
git reset 724b6076e3b1b0299344454f4ec59059cfbe8d75
```

...will cause it to end up like this:

```
HEAD -> point-me-elsewhere -> 724b6076e3b1b0299344454f4ec59059cfbe8d75
```

**BONUS**: If you include the `--hard` option, this will also change the working
directory, meaning you can use this command to reverse *Edit the file* en masse!

### rm

This command lets you *Remove the file*. Same syntax as `git add`.

## Baby learns to write

### commit

FINALLY we can commit something! Once you have some files staged, you can commit
like so:

#### Simple

```sh
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

That's it! Your changes were bundled into a commit whose parent is your current
`HEAD`, then the equivalent of a `git reset <NEW_COMMIT_HASH>` happens.

#### Long form

If you have a particularly long commit message to write, you can do it like so:

```sh
git commit
```

This will open your editor where you can write the commit message. Once you
close your editor, the commit will push through.

#### Amend

If you made an unforgivable mistake and need to edit the commit you're currently
on, you can stage your fixes and do either of the following:

```sh
git commit --amend -m "Your improved commit message"
```

```sh
git commit --amend
```

There are ways to edit entire histories, but that's for later.

## Baby learns to read what it wrote

### status

If you want to check the status of your repository, just run:

```sh
git status
```

A lot of command prompts already run this so that you can immediately tell if
your repository is clean, has untracked files, has modified files, etc.

### diff

If you want to see all the differences between between two commits, run:

```sh
git diff <ORIGIN_COMMIT> <TARGET_COMMIT> # <TARGET_COMMIT> defaults to `HEAD`
```

### merge

Now let's pretend that you have two branches, `master` and `broken-feature`. If
you want to update the `master` branch to have all the changes done on
`broken-feature`, just run the following while on the `master` branch:

```sh
git merge broken-feature
```

If git reports that the merge was successfull, then you can rest easy. However,
if git says there are conflicts that you have to resolve manually, we still have
some work left to do.

#### Conflict resolution

If a merge fails, git will mark the conflicted sections in your files like so:

```text
<<<<<<<
Changes made on the branch that is being merged into. In most cases,
this is the branch that I have currently checked out (i.e. HEAD).
=======
Changes made on the branch that is being merged in. This is often a
feature / topic branch.
>>>>>>>
```

To solve this problem, you will have to edit the file manually so that it's in
the ideal state after merging. This means removing the markers too. After that,
`git add` the modified files and run `git commit` to continue.

[*( sauce )*](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/161813/how-to-resolve-merge-conflicts-in-git)

#### Cleanup

After merging, remember to clean up your obsolete branches:

```sh
git branch -d <YOUR_OBSOLETE_BRANCH>
```

## Baby learns to talk

This baby learned things in the weirdest order, but let's keep going. For the
baby.

### remote

We've talked about what remotes are for, but we haven't discussed how to manage
them. Here are the most common commands you would use for that purpose:

- List remotes:

  ```sh
  git remote
  git remote -v # Also --verbose, lists all remotes and their URLs
  ```

- Add a remote:

  ```sh
  git remote add <REMOTE_NAME> <REMOTE_URL>
  ```

- Rename a remote:

  ```sh
  git remote rename <OLD_REMOTE_NAME> <NEW_REMOTE_NAME>
  ```

- Change a remote's URL:

  ```sh
  git remote set-url <REMOTE_NAME> <NEW_URL>
  ```

### fetch

If you want to update your remote-tracking branches, you can make fetch happen:

```sh
git fetch <REMOTE_NAME> # <REMOTE_NAME> defaults to `origin`
```

You can also use the following options:
  - If you have multiple remotes, `--all` will fetch from all of them.
  - `-p` (also `--prune`) will delete all remote-tracking branches that have
  already been deleted on the remote.

### merge

There is another dimension to the merge command. If you are on branch with a
corresponding remote-tracking branch, just running `git merge` will attempt to
merge the remote branch with your local as if you ran it like this:

```sh
git merge <REMOTE_NAME>/<BRANCH_NAME>
```

### pull

Pulling (`git pull`) is really just a shortcut for doing the following:

```sh
git fetch
git merge
```

### push

To make a remote branch reflect your local branch:

```sh
git push <REMOTE_NAME> <BRANCH_NAME>
```

`<REMOTE_NAME>` will default to `origin` while `<BRANCH_NAME>` will default to
your current branch.

#### Use the force

Pushing will fail if there are any conflicts with the remote branch. If the
branch is something other people are also working on, it's best to resolve those
conflicts locally first before attempting another push. Otherwise, you may use
force push:

```sh
git push <REMOTE_NAME> <BRANCH_NAME> -f # Also --force
```

***Only use this if you're confident that you're the only one working on this
branch and that you won't lose any work from overwriting the remote branch.***

## Baby learns how to drive a car

**\*sniff\*** They grow up so fast. **\*tear\***

### .gitignore

Sometimes, running git status keeps telling you that there are untracked files
but you know deep down in your heart that you will **never** ***EVER*** track
those files, no matter how much they begged you to.

.

.

.

**Just add them to a `.gitignore` file! ^\_\_^**

For example:

```
.gitignore
==========
secret.key
*.log
```

### stash

Imagine that you're in the middle of working on something when all of a sudden
an urgent bug is reported and it needs to be fixed yesterday. Do you just
hopelessly throw away all of your work to switch over to fixing the bug?

Gee, I dunno, does the sun rise in the west?

Use git stash, ya dumdum!

- Run `git stash` to move all of your mid-work changes into the stash.
- Fix the super important bug.
- Celebrate fixing the bug by listening to some [Electric Six](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXQCrOEx1-g).
- Go back to the branch from which you ran `git stash`
- Run `git stash pop` to restore the changes that you stashed earlier.

### cherry-pick

You want `<COMMIT_A>` replayed on top of `<COMMIT_B>`? No problem!

```sh
git checkout <COMMIT_B>
git cherry-pick <COMMIT_A>
```

`<COMMIT_A>` and `<COMMIT_B>` can be any commit identifier.

### revert

Sometimes, your mistakes are too deep in the history tree for you to use `git
commit --amend`. In these cases, you can use `git revert <COMMIT_IDENTIFIER>` to
create a new commit that effectively does the exact opposite of what
`<COMMIT_IDENTIFIER>` did.

## Baby learns how to do brain surgery

Baby no more, adult yes less.

### rebase

Rebasing is the art of changing the course of history. It is also very useful in
keeping the history linear, which is helpful in preserving certain bits of
information and making diagnosis and debugging easier.

The basic use case of rebase is when you want to replay all of the changes on a
branch onto another branch **without creating a new commit**. This is done like
so:

```sh
git checkout <BRANCH_YOU_WANT_TO_MERGE>
git rebase <BRANCH_YOU_WANT_TO_MERGE_INTO>
```

When this is done before merging, what is called a "fast-forward" is possible,
meaning no additional commit for the merge has to be created, preserving a
linear history. Some complications may also arise from merge commits that have
two parents, which is common for unrebased branches.

This doesn't always run free of conflicts, however, and you might be asked to
resolve some manually. To do so, just stage your changes and `git rebase
--continue`. Or `git rebase --abort` if you are a scared little baby.

Another mode is to use rebase interactively like so:

```sh
git rebase -i # Also --interactive
```

This gives even more control, allowing you to reorder, drop, and modify entire
commits. Use with caution.

### bisect

If you are trying to figure out which commit introduced a particular bug, `git
bisect` is your best friend. This tool basically lets you do a binary search
over a long history tree to pinpoint the offending commit.

- Run `git bisect start`
- Check out a commit that you know has the bug and run `git bisect bad`
- Check out a commit that you know is free of the bug and run `git bisect good`

Git will then continuously ask you to evaluate commits with either `git bisect
good` or `git bisect bad` until it points out the first bad commit.
